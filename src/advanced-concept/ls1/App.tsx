/**
 * Code-splitting
 *
 * The React.lazy function lets you render
 * a dynamic import as a regular component.
 *
 * 'React.lazy' takes a function that must call a dynamic 'import()'.
 * This must return a 'Promise' which resolves to a module with a
 * 'default' export containing a React component.
 *
 * React.lazy and Suspense are not yet available for server-side rendering.
 * If you want to do code-splitting in a server rendered app,
 * we recommend Loadable Components (https://loadable-components.com/).
 * It has a nice guide for bundle splitting with server-side rendering.
